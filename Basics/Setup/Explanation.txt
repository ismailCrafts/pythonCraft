üõ† How to Set Up Your Python Development Environment (Beginner-Friendly)
To start coding in Python, we need two things:

Python (the programming language itself)

A code editor (to write and manage our code)

Let‚Äôs go through the setup step by step.

‚úÖ Step 1: Install Python
Go to the official Python website:
üëâ https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download the latest version of Python:

Choose the right file for your operating system:

For Windows: download the .exe file

For macOS or Linux: download the appropriate file for your system

Install Python:

After the download is complete, go to your Downloads folder

Double-click the Python installer (e.g., python-3.x.x.exe)

Follow the on-screen instructions

Important: Check the box that says ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù before clicking "Install"

Verify the installation:

Open your Terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

Type the following command and press Enter:

bash
Copy
Edit
python --version
If Python is installed correctly, it will show the version number (e.g., Python 3.12.0)

‚úÖ Step 2: Install a Code Editor (Visual Studio Code)
There are many code editors out there (e.g., Atom, PyCharm, Sublime Text), but we recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) because it‚Äôs lightweight, beginner-friendly, and widely used in the industry.

Download VS Code:
üëâ https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Install VS Code:

Download the file that matches your OS (e.g., .exe for Windows)

Go to your Downloads folder

Double-click the installer and follow the instructions

‚úÖ Step 3: Set Up Python in VS Code
To run Python code in VS Code, we need to install the Python extension.

Open Visual Studio Code

On the left sidebar, click the Extensions icon (or press Ctrl+Shift+X)

In the search bar, type "Python"

Click on the extension named Python (published by Microsoft)

Click Install

Once installed, VS Code will recognize Python files and let you run your code directly from the editor.

üéâ You're All Set!
You‚Äôve now installed Python and VS Code, and connected them together. You‚Äôre ready to start writing your first Python program.
